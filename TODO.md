# TODO

* Cleanup/fix the `/` manual redirection to `README.md` -- the way
  it's done is a real hack

* option for [[TOC]] to skip the first and/or last N levels--including
  the title of the document in the TOC is definitely annoying

* option to omit footer, or substitute a new one

# DONE

* `FileModTime` variable for template which is the `stat.mtime` and can
  be used in the footer.
